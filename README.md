# FACE-DETECTION-IN-VIDEOS

## IMAGE FACE DETECTION USING VIOLA- JONES:






Face detection is an important task in computer vision and is used in a wide range of applications such as security systems, photo tagging, and video analytics. One of the most widely used methods for face detection is the Haar Cascade Classifier, which was introduced by Viola and Jones in their seminal paper "Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features".

In this Repo, we will explore the basic concepts of Haar Cascade Classifiers and how they can be used for face detection. We will also provide a small example using Open CV to detect faces in an image.

## How do Haar Cascade Classifiers work?

Haar Cascade Classifiers work by sliding a sub-window over the image and extracting a set of features for each sub-window. The features are calculated using Haar wavelets and can be represented as a vector. The classifier then uses the vector of features to predict whether the sub-window contains a face or not. The process of detecting a face using a Haar Cascade Classifier can be summarized as follows:

Sliding a sub-window over the image
Extracting a set of features for each sub-window using Haar wavelets
 Classifying the sub-window as either containing a face or not using the learned model
The sub-windows are typically scaled to different sizes to account for variations in the size of faces in the image.
